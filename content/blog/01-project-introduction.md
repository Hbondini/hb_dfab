## The Motivation
I am a cyclist first. Having worked in the industry for years, I have developed a deep love for all things cycling. For me, the joy isn't just in the act of riding; it’s in fixing, customizing, and talking shop with friends.

However, the current direction of the bicycle industry has become frustrating. The major brands are in a relentless pursuit of "performance" defined solely by the professional racer. While this sells bikes, it has taken bicycle design down a path that fails the general rider. Modern bikes are becoming harder to fix, harder to fit, and harder to customize.

While the big brands chase aerodynamics and stiffness at the cost of usability, small independent builders offer an alternative, but this alternative brings its own compromises.

## The Compromise: Metal vs. Carbon
If you want a bike built specifically for you today, you are largely forced into a binary choice:

### 1. The Metal Route (Accessible but Limited)
Many independent builders specialize in steel, aluminum, or titanium. This involves welding or brazing pre-made tubes. This is a beautiful craft that allows for custom geometry, but it is limited by the material properties. You cannot tune the ride quality of a steel tube the way you can a composite structure.

### 2. The Carbon Route (Performance at a Price)
Carbon fiber is the superior material for performance tuning, but it comes at an exorbitant cost. Creating custom molds for an individual rider is incredibly time-consuming and expensive, pushing the price of a single custom carbon frame well over **$10,000**.

## The Engineering Thesis
My capstone project, **HB_DFab**, aims to break this compromise.

I am working to **lower the cost of entry** for custom carbon bicycle manufacturing. My goal is to automate the labor-intensive parts of the process using a range of novel methods and machines built entirely in-house.

### The Approach
My manufacturing system relies on three methods to achieve this goal:

1.  **Automated Filament Winding:** I have designed and built a 3-axis filament winder to produce carbon tubing. This allows me to tune the stiffness and compliance of the frame via code rather than manual layup, standardizing the process while allowing for infinite length variations.
2.  **Trapped Rubber Molding:** Moving away from expensive metal molds, I am utilizing 3D printed tooling paired with heat-expanding silicone mandrels to consolidate the composite parts.
3.  **Hybrid Metal Lugs:** By utilizing **Metal Powder Casting** for the junctions, I can create complex, custom geometries without the tooling costs of traditional manufacturing.

## The End Game
This project is about proving that we don't have to choose between "Custom Metal" and "Expensive Carbon." By building the machines myself and validating these hybrid techniques, I want to demonstrate a workflow where high-performance, custom-geometry bikes are accessible, repairable, and built for the rider—not just the racer.
