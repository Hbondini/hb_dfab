## The Archive
This portfolio documents the complete engineering lifecycle of the **HB_DFab** capstone. It is divided into three primary engineering streams:

* [cite_start]**Machine Design:** The design and fabrication of the 3-axis filament winder[cite: 1793].
* [cite_start]**Process Engineering:** The development of the "Trapped Rubber" molding workflow and HT-PLA-GF tooling[cite: 1793].
* [cite_start]**Material Science:** The investigation into hybrid metal powder casting and carbon fiber bonding[cite: 1793].

*Below is the chronological log of these developments.*
