## The Motivation
I am a cyclist first. My passion runs deep and spans every discipline, from tarmac to trail. But the more I ride, the more I realize that modern bicycle design often fails the rider.

The industry prioritizes speed and stiffness above all else. If you don't fit the standard mold, you are often pigeonholed into two extremes: **Custom Steel** (accessible but heavy) or **Custom Carbon** (exorbitantly expensive).

I believe there is a better way. [cite_start]My capstone project, **HB_DFab**, aims to show that the custom bike-making process—currently very labor-intensive—can be democratized through process automation[cite: 3].

## The Engineering Thesis: "Mass Customization"
My approach separates the bicycle frame into two distinct manufacturing streams to achieve customization without the cost:

### 1. The Tubes: Standardization
I am utilizing **Filament Winding** to completely standardize the tube manufacturing process. By using a single machine and a single set of molds, I can produce high-performance carbon tubing of any length. [cite_start]Custom sizing becomes as simple as cutting the tube to a different length, with no additional tooling required[cite: 3].

### 2. The Lugs: Digital Flexibility
Carbon fiber struggles with complex junctions; metal excels at them. By utilizing **Metal Powder Casting** and **3D Printing**, I can generate custom lug geometries digitally. [cite_start]This allows for unique angles and fits without incurring the massive tooling costs associated with traditional molds[cite: 3].

## The "Process" Obsession
I chose to build my own 4-axis filament winder rather than buying one. This was a strategic decision driven by two factors:

1.  **Cost & Accessibility:** proving that advanced composite manufacturing doesn't require six-figure equipment.
2.  **Mastery:** I want intimate knowledge of the machinery. [cite_start]I need to understand every variable that goes into the composite structure, rather than being an operator who just "knows how to press the go button"[cite: 3].

[cite_start]This project is not just an academic exercise; it is the foundation of knowledge required to potentially build a business in the future[cite: 3].

## The Risks (Technical Debt)
This is an ambitious R&D project, and the path is not clear. My current engineering concerns include:

* **Winder Reliability:** The machine is not yet running at 100% reliability. [cite_start]The current winding pattern leaves gaps in the layers, requiring a rewrite of the G-code generation algorithm to ensure full coverage[cite: 3].
* **Mold Failure:** I am experimenting with 3D printed molds (HT-PLA-GF) utilizing trapped-rubber silicone expansion. [cite_start]There is a significant risk that the silicone pressure will cause the printed molds to split apart or deform, leading to wasted time and materials[cite: 3].
* **Bond Integrity:** The ultimate question is safety. Will the metal lugs bond correctly to the carbon tubes? Will the tolerances of the powder casting be precise enough? [cite_start]The bike must not only look aesthetically pleasing but be safe to ride[cite: 3].

## The End Game
The goal is to produce a fully finished, rideable prototype that validates this hybrid manufacturing ecosystem.
